### Summary of old requirements documentation

Cupid Code is a dating assistant for nerds with a central focus on AI. It provides users AI chat assistance on dates, and helps to schedule and execute dating activities. It also includes an interface for "cupids," who are employees of Cupid Code who perform tasks to help our customers while they are on dates. Cupid code was started by another team of students from a previous semester of CS3450 at Utah State University. They outlined the overarching vision, functional design, and user stories for the application. This portion of the new requirements document summarizes the requirements given by the former team of developers including problem statement, solution concept, functional and non-functional requirements, user requirements, and user stories.

### Problem Statement

Dating poses challenges due to the high stakes of forming a romantic relationship with someone unfamiliar. There are many social pitfalls to fall into, and often, people find that there is little outside help available. This difficulty is especially pronounced for computer scientists and "nerd" types, who already have a reputation for struggling with interpersonal relationships. There is a need for a solution that addresses these common dating hurdles by providing tailored support for individuals in this demographic, enhancing their ability to form meaningful connections.

### Solution

Preparing for a date can be intimidating, and it can be tough to know what to say or how to act. Cupid Code is a revolutionary dating assistance platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to help individuals through that process. Cupid Code supplies the user with an artificial intelligence (AI) partner that the user can ask questions and get tips for the date. It can even listen in on the conversation and provide immediate assistance when it senses trouble. If a planned activity falls through, then the AI can pay for an item or service and call for a “Cupid”, a hired assistant, to deliver it right to you during the date.

### Functional Requirements

The last team specified the following categories of functional requirements:

1. User Authentication: Users verify their identity through email.
2. Roles: Users include Daters, Cupids, and Managers.
* Daters manage their dating profile page, funds, scheduling, cupid feedback, and AI chats.
* Cupids interact with requests, complete jobs, manage their earnings, and review feedback.
* Managers interact with application analytics and monitor policy violations.
3. AI integration: AI listens when asked to, gives dating and conversational advice, and summons Cupids when appropriate.
4. Budget Management: Daters must be able to control spending, allowing the AI to spend only within their budget.
5. Date Scheduling: There should be a user friendly scheduling interface for daters.
6. Payment system: Daters deposit money and cupids are paid for their work.
