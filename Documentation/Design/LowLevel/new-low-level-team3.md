# 0. Team Conventions
[*Table of Contents*](#table-of-contents)

The Sinister-six will be following all of the same conventions outlined by the previous team, see [previous team's conventions](./low_level_docs.md#team-conventions-and-standards), except for the following changes outlined below.

## Branching
We will classify our branches into these four types, to keep our version control workflow consistent and coherent.
* *master*
  * Always working; whenever merges are done we do not get up/stop working until we are confident *master* is functioning with the new code that was merged in.
  * The actual application Users are using will be built/deployed with this code.
* *hotfix*
  * Branched off of *master*.
  * For fixing issues we missed when merging into *master* from *development*
* *development*
  * Branched off of *master*.
  * Get code ready to merge with *master*.
* *feature/fixes*
  * Branched off of *development*.
  * Development of features and experimentation of ideas which will merge into *development* once they are functioning.

## Coding Standards
We will follow all of the same coding standards, see [previous code standards](./low_level_docs.md#coding-standards), except for the following:
* New lines of code will be limited to 100 columns or less rather than the previous limit of 200 to increase code readability.
* Attention will be made to import only the methods, attributes, objects, etc...which we actually use from a package rather than blanket imports of entire packages. I.e. use `from _ import _, _, ...` rather than `import _`.

### Security
The previous team had done a good job in maintaining security within the app. They did not implement a strong password system, which we will implement by... 

If a user loses their account information, a form of Two-Step Authentication will be provided to allow them to reset their password and enter their account. Managers will also require Two-Step Authentication every time they log in. We will do this by...

We also intend to make calls to external APIs and thus we need to ensure that we safeguard any response that could be malicious. We will do this by...

### Performance
TODO - That said, I don't think there's a whole lot that we can do on the frontend for this except for make sure we keep it lightweight.

### UI
TODO - Add a dark theme, change up the colors and web page (we're going to need to update all the images), create a "Plan-a-Date" page

### Vue Router

The previous team used Vue Router to switch between pages in the frontend. They used hash routing to control which page the user is on which allows the frontend to switch pages without contacting the server every time. We will continue to use this routing method and take care to keep track of the state of the application to keep the frontend light and responsive.

The following is an example fo how Vue Router is used in the application:
```javascript
import create web history, web hash history from 'vue-router';

import Home from './components/Home.vue';
import About from './components/Dater.vue';
import Contact from './components/Cupid.vue';

const routes = [
  { path: '/', name: 'Home', component: Home },
  { path: '/dater/:id', name: 'Dater', component: Dater },
  { path: '/cupid', name: 'Cupid', component: Cupid }
];

const router = create_web_history({
  history: web hash history,
  routes
});

export default router;
```
The ':' in "path: '/dater/:id'" symbolizes a parameter to be passed through the path. This was used to pass the user id when making calls to the backend. We are unsure as to why the previous team passed the id in way as it is possible to accomplish this using state variables. As we work on the routing, if we discover that passing the id through the state instead of the url is more efficient, then we will make the necessary changes.

#### Implementing the router

In the **main.js** file we include the router and mount it. Other pages can import the router to use programmatic routing or use the router-link tag in components:

``` javascript
import router from './router/router.js'

router.go(1) // Forward 1
router.forward() // ^
router.go(-1) // Back 1
router.back() // ^

// Route the user to this path with the given params.
router.push({name: "Path Name", params: {param: given param}})
```

```html
  <nav>
    <router-link :to="{name: 'Path name', params: {param: given param}}">
      Go here!
    </router-link>
    <router-link :to="{name: 'Path name', params: {param: given param}}">
      Or here!
    </router-link>
  </nav>
  <div>
    Other components from the page get displayed here.
  </div>  
<template>
```

### Vue URLs
The Vue app will live at URL `/app/`. The following pages will be available through the Vue Router. 

| URL                 | Notes               |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| /                   | Welcome page        |
| /login              | Login page          |
| /register           | Signup page         |
| /dater/home/:id     | dater homepage      |
| /dater/chat/:id     | dater chat page     |
| /dater/listen/:id   | dater listen page   |
| /dater/balance/:id  | dater cash page     |
| /dater/calendar/:id | dater calendar page |
| /dater/feedback/:id | dater feedback page |
| /dater/gigs/:id     | dater gigs page     |
| /dater/profile/:id  | dater profile page  |
| /cupid/home/:id     | cupid homepage      |
| /cupid/gigs/        | cupid gigs          |
| /cupid/balance/:id  | cupid balance       |
| /cupid/profile/:id  | cupid profile       |
| /cupid/feedback/:id | cupid feedback page |
| /manager/home/:id   | manager homepage    |
| /manager/cupids/    | manager reports     |
| /manager/daters/    | manager reports     |

The :id syntax is using the params syntax from the Vue Router. These are the URLs that are going to need an id of some sort. If the id is not valid for the page that is being accessed (i.e. dater user trying to access a manager page), a 404 page will be served instead.

### Testing
We intend to continue using and building upon the existing testing framework going forward in the development of the product. Testing is done in the following ways:

0. **Unit Testing**: Unit tests isolate functions and methods and verify that it outputs the way it is intended. Focus on testing edge cases and potential invalid inputs.

0. **Component Testing**: Vue Test Utils is used to test Vue components and simulate user interactions.

0. **Integration Testing**: Integration tests will verify that multiple components work together and ensure the entire application can work.

0. **Mocking**: Mocking is a technique used in testing to isolate a component that may rely on other components. By using mocking you can "mock" what a function should return and thereby control the behavior of external dependencies to focus entirely on the component under test.

The tests will be run in a CICD pipeline to ensure that changes to the app do not break working functionality. If a change to the code alters what a function inputs and outputs, the developer who made the change is in charge of fixing the corresponding test and ensuring that it works.
